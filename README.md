# AdventOfCode

## Usage
* Install required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Entrypoint is `main.py` in the root directory
* Year and Day are read from the command line arguments
* Example: `python main.py 2017 1`


## Automated download of inputs
A puzzle's input is downloaded the first time a day is executed and then cached after the initial download (`get_inputs/load/load_input()`) 

In case the input is corrupted, delete the file manually and run the code again, to download a fresh copy of the input.
